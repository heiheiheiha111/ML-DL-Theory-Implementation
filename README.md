# 🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Theory to Code

## 📖 About
This repository documents my journey in mastering Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It contains detailed **Jupyter Notebooks** that bridge the gap between mathematical theory and executable Python code.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- **Andrew Ng's Specialization:** Notes and assignments implementation.
- **Algorithm Reproduction:** Implementing core algorithms (Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Transformer) from scratch using `NumPy` to understand the underlying logic.
- **Math Foundations:** Linear Algebra and Calculus notes related to AI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
- PyTorch (Basic)
